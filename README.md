# Analysis of Job Popularity as a Software Developer in Canada

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the popularity of software developer jobs in Canada. The project involves data scraping, cleaning, integration, and visualization to provide insights into job trends and opportunities in the software development field. The project workflow is detailed below.

## Project Workflow

1. **Web Scrape Data from Multiple Sources**: 
   - Used Selenium WebDriver in Python to scrape job listings and related data from various online sources.
   
2. **Clean the Scraped Data**: 
   - Data was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, irrelevant information, and to standardize the format for analysis.
   
3. **Merge the Cleaned Data**: 
   - Combined the cleaned data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
   
4. **Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for Multiple Weeks**: 
   - Conducted the scraping and cleaning process weekly to gather updated information and maintain dataset relevance.
   
5. **Merge the Weekly Data into a Final Dataset**: 
   - Integrated the weekly data into a final comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   
6. **Store the Final Data in SQL Server**: 
   - Stored the final cleaned and integrated dataset in Microsoft SQL Server for efficient querying and management.
   
7. **Use Tableau to Visualize the Results**: 
   - Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to present the analyzed data and provide visual insights into job trends.

## Note

This project cannot be run at a later date due to potential updates in the class IDs on the webpages. The script used for data scraping may need modifications to adapt to changes in the webpage structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For web scraping data from online job listings.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, integration, and processing.
- **MS SQL Server**: For storing the final dataset.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Project Status

This project is considered complete and is presented as a demonstration of skills in data collection, processing, and visualization. The insights gained from the dashboard provide valuable information on job trends for software developers in Canada.
